# Digital-Clock
A JavaScript-based digital clock that displays the current time in a web browser.

The JavaScript Digital Clock project is a web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic digital clock that displays the current time in a browser. The HTML structure provides the foundation for the clock display, while CSS is used for styling elements such as font size, color, and layout to enhance the visual appearance. JavaScript is the core component responsible for updating the clock's time dynamically.

At its core, the JavaScript code fetches the current time from the user's system using the Date object and then formats it into hours, minutes, and seconds. This formatted time is then injected into the corresponding HTML elements representing the hours, minutes, and seconds on the clock face. To ensure real-time updates, the setInterval() method is employed to continuously refresh the displayed time at regular intervals, typically every second.

The project can be customized further by adding features such as time zone conversion, AM/PM display, or even implementing additional functionalities like stopwatch or countdown timer. Overall, the JavaScript Digital Clock project is a practical and educational exercise that demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to create interactive and dynamic elements on a web page.
